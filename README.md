### Project Scope
As we all know that food is the basic need in every human life, for which everyone is struggling. Nowadays, people are occupied with their busy schedules, they either can’t able to cook or not having time to make food and order their food from outside.
	
Benefits of food ordering platforms:-  
* The food ordering process easier for customers as well as for restaurant owners.
* Easy order management.
* Less processing time means less waiting time for food orders.
* Live order tracking.
* It is very easy to customize the food order. 

### Technology Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript 

### Next Steps
* In order to extend the website, the first thing I’ll do is to add a login/signup page to have a check on number of people interested in the website.
* Ask for few personal details for delivering the order and for confirmation.
* Also, I add the other crucial things just after that, like for ordering food we need to check the item availability which is done by maintaining a database. 
* For  payment purpose, we need a secured payment gateway.
* For more functionality, we can put filters on food items or on categories.
